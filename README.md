Project Overview: ROLL is an educational and analytical tool designed to simulate and visualize how independent random paths eventually converge into a single shared path. It implements a game-like logic where players move across a sequence of random dice rolls, demonstrating fundamental concepts in probability and stochastic processes.

Core Features & Technical Implementation:

Interactive Simulation Engine: Users can define the number of simulations and players to observe convergence patterns under different parameters.

Stochastic Path Calculation: Implements custom logic to generate random sequences and track player movements based on the values of the "jumps".

Data Visualization: Integrated with Matplotlib to generate real-time histograms showing the frequency distribution of the steps required for path matching.

GUI Design: Developed using Tkinter, featuring a multi-window interface for viewing raw step data, matching results, and statistical charts.

Numerical Analysis: Utilizes NumPy and collections.Counter for efficient processing and frequency analysis of simulation results.

Technical Stack:

Language: Python.

GUI Framework: Tkinter.

Data Visualization: Matplotlib.

Libraries: NumPy, Random, Collections.
